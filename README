ConfigFile
----------

Introduction
------------

ConfigFile provides a very simple configuration file implementation for
Ada 2005 programs.  It can store/recall Boolean/Float/Long_Float/String
values.

Notes
-----

1.  Whitespace and control characters are trimmed from the beginning and
    end of control keys/values.

2.  Storing strings with embedded LF/CR characters will not work correctly.

3.  Maximum Key/Value size is limited by available stack space when loading
    from disk.

4.  Not task safe; accesses from multiple tasks should be serialized.

Licence
-------

GPL Version 3 (or later) with linking/generic exception (commonly known as
the "GNAT Modified GPL").
